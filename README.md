This project is deeply meaningful to me. I was a primary caretaker for my dear Gramma Catherine, whose health started to plummet shortly after I graduated. I put my job hunt on hold for many weeks to be with her. Nearly blind, she constantly struggled to read her clock. I got an idea, and within 24 hours I was able to make this talking clock app for her. With a tap on the iPad, it announces the time, as well as a recorded message from me.
